Probably my sloppiest den and edit together. Today I went to three doctors to get my final diagnosis as a teen and let me tell you.. My world fell to bits. The only thing keeping me going is sleeping, drawing and edits like these. I'm tired. I don't feel like fighting. 🤦‍♀️ *I WILL REDO THIS EDIT IN THE FUTURE.

I came home to this in the mail today, The contracts and my IFBB Procard. It's still seems like a dream that I am ACTUALLY competing at this level in a few weeks. *
As I signed this and mail them out, I am very honored and proud to be representing Hawaii And Team Kawasaki in the professional stage. Mike Kawasaki @thekawasakiway01 raised me since I was 148lbs novice 5 years ago.

Rollin with the homie// I was never really good with friends and I fell awkward veryyy easily. There was a time no one talked to me, and I sat alone everyday. I can always see everyone having a 'best friend' they can resort to, everytime. But I have to think whether I should be at all telling someone something, lest it becomes a popular rumour the next day. But this guy waltzed in as my love, and slowly grew on to be my best friend. Someone I can always go back to no matter what happens. Somehow within one person, I found my everything. 
Yesterday was a lovely day. Fighting over the pillows during the movie, pretending to be drunk with Sprite, the business games, and you doing chottamo (😑) and all the other things (If you know what I mean 😉) was wonderful and I enjoyed after a really long time. Let's just hope that we stay how we are, the rad and mad people we are.
